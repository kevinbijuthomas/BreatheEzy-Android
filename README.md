# BreatheEzy-Android

This repository contains the source code for my Android app BreatheEzy, a personalized app made for a client of mine. My client suffers from asthma and thus, I created this app to improve the client's awareness of the condition, adhere to treatment, and manage his symptoms adequately (especially in emergency situations). It also permits my client to self-assess his condition to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions.

I built the app using Android Studio as I would be able to emulate the app and quickly detect design and functionality problems. I use Room as the backend database, harnessing SQLite to locally store data.
